### 📊 Key Trends

* **Recent Increase**: Between April 2023 and March 2024, over 118,000 young people aged 16–24 presented to their local authority as homeless or at risk of homelessness, marking a 10% increase from the previous year. ([Centrepoint][1])

### 📈 Historical Context

* **1990s–2000s**: Youth homelessness data from this period is limited, but available reports suggest fluctuations influenced by economic conditions and policy changes. ([Crisis][4])

* **2008–2012**: The global financial crisis led to increased youth homelessness due to rising unemployment and housing instability.
